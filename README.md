I'm not familier with json files, didn't had the time to access the json file via functions.
implementing getMovies(), getTheaters(), buyTicket(), isValidTicket() should be straigh forward search by strings.
should have written in the json file each complex with its theaters, and the orderd tickets' IDs.
